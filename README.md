# Forecasting Credit Card Payment Default
This case study focuses on identifying borrowers who are likely to default in the next two years with serious delinquency, i.e. having a delinquency of more than three months. The objective is to build a machine learning model using general borrower profile attributes such as age, monthly income, and dependents, as well as historical data such as debt ratio, credit utilization ratio, and past default history. The goal is to predict whether the borrower is likely to default in the next two years or not. The resulting predictions will help banks take necessary actions to avoid bad loans and improve their overall image.
